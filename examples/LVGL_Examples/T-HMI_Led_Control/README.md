# T-HMI LED Control
This project provides firmware and code examples for controlling LEDs using the T-HMI board. It includes source files for hardware initialization and LED control logic.

## Features
- LED control via T-HMI board
- Image and font assets for UI

## Folder Structure
- `t-hmi_led_control.ino` — Main Arduino sketch
- `data.cpp`, `data.h` — Data handling logic
- `init_code.h`, `pins.h`, `lv_conf.h` — Hardware and LVGL configuration
- `image/` — Logo and image assets

## Usage
- After uploading, the T-HMI board will run the LED control functionality.
- Modify `t-hmi_led_control.ino` to customize LED behavior.
